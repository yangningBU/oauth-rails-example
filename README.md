# OAuth Test App

Unfortunately this example lugs around a huge unnecessary Rails app. But the principle works.

## Code Setup
- download the repo
- install rails with `gem install rails`
- then install the project dependencies with `bundle install`
- turn on the server with `rails s`
- then open your broswer to http://lvh.me:8000/

## Github Setup
- log into your Github account, click on your user icon, and then Settings
- click on "" in the bottom left:
`<img>`
- click on "generate new app" and fill in something like this:
`<img>`
- go through the "webhook" setup flow since it's required by Github, but we're not using it in this example
